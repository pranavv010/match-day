## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites
- Android Studio Panda 4.
- An API Key from [API-Sports (Football)](https://dashboard.api-football.com/).
- A Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) (optional; home screen uses bundled fallbacks without it).

### 2. Configuration
Copy `local.properties.example` to `local.properties` in the project root and add your keys:

```properties
sdk.dir=/path/to/Android/Sdk
API_KEY_PRIMARY=your_api_sports_primary_key
API_KEY_BACKUP_1=your_api_sports_backup_key_1
API_KEY_BACKUP_2=your_api_sports_backup_key_2
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
```

- **API-Sports keys** power live scores and match sync.
- **Gemini key** powers the home screen quiz, quotes, and facts (falls back to bundled content if missing).

`local.properties` is gitignored — never commit API keys.

### 3. Build & Run
Clone the repository and build the project in Android Studio.
